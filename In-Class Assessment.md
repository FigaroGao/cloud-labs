Please answer the following questions and submit it to your git repo with name "In-Class Assessment 1"

(a)	Describe the three primary cloud service models in cloud computing infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Provide specific examples of how each model can be applied in the context of software development.  
Iass: AWS;Azure;VMware  
e.g. IT administrator Network architects  
Pass: Flynn;Cloud Foundry;Heroku  
e.g. Software engineer  
Sass: Gmail;Slack;Office365  
e.g. enduser  
(b)	What is Docker? Describe a scenario where you would use containerization technologies such as Docker in software development. How does containerization contribute to the development and deployment process of software in this scenario?  
Docker is a container platform that packages applications and their dependencies together, ensuring they can run in different environments.
For example, when a development team is working on a web application, they can use Docker to package the environment (Node.js + DB) and run the container directly.  
Pro: consistent environment, fast deployment, and no interference.  
(c) Deploy n8n (n8n.io) with Docker and capture a screenshot of http://127.0.0.1:5678. Please explain the docker command in detail.
