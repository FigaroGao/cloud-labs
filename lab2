2. use a data comparison utility such as Meld and [Beyond Compare] to compare the configuration files attached to see where the changes should be made.

3. configure the config.yaml for the lighthouse and all participating computers.

4. some useful example commands for MAC OS:
 brew install nebula
 nebula-cert -version
 nebula-cert ca –name #it will report error. No worries.
 nebula-cert ca –name "LeiNetwork"
 nebula-cert sign -name "lighthouse" -ip "192.168.100.1/24"
 nebula-cert sign -name "MBP15" -ip "192.168.100.15/24"
 nebula-cert sign -name "mini" -ip "192.168.100.10/24"
 sudo nebula -config ~/.nebula/config.yaml
