Building Your Personal Website with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) — specifically a Static Web Hosting PaaS — that allows you to host a static website directly from a GitHub repository. You do not need to manage servers, scaling, or deployment pipelines; everything is handled seamlessly by GitHub. In this project, you will create and publish your own personal website using GitHub Pages. 

This project will help you:
1. Learn the fundamentals of web publishing.
